## Design

### Colors
- The color palette was carefully selected using the free palette creation service [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). The secondary color opacity was reduced to 30% for a dark red effect.

### Fonts
Two fonts are used on this website:
- **Druk Wide Cy Web** is used for the logo and headings in each section. It was downloaded from the free font repository [8font.com](https://8font.com/).
- **Inter** is used for the main body text. It was sourced from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Images
- All images on this website were sourced from the free service [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/).
They were then converted from PNG to WebP format using the free tool [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/), and their sizes were optimized using [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)

### Wireframes
- I developed the website design using Figma, a collaborative design tool. The wireframes were created to visually plan the layout and user interface of the website before development began.
